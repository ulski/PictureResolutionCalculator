# PictureResolutionCalculator

This spreadsheet can help you calculate the proper size for an image which are to be printed on paper. Depending on the size of the paper and the dpi resolution of the printer (dot per inch), the spreadsheet will help you determine the amount of pixels needed.
I created this spreadsheet for own use, in order to find the optimal image size when I produce digitally rendered images, which I later want to print in poster size.
You may download the spreadsheet in excel or open document format below.
